# TODO

This file captures miscellaneous TODO items which are not recorded in the REQUIREMENTS.md file.

## Definitely

* Keep some context on screen when showing spinner (e.g. when navigating between pages)
* Wait for a short time before showing the spinner
* Show a status message under spinner (e.g. "loading page 2")
* Instead of inheriting from ListViewXxx, it should be instantiated via the parent component's render() function.
* API timeout / cancel
* Handle API errors
* Gesture-based navigation (e.g. swipes) between pages
* Jump to page


## Maybe

* Wire pagination into Navigator
