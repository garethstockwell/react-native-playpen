# Development process

## Resources

Does TheFB have any of the following we can use?
* Version control server
* Code review server
* Bug tracker

How is the development server managed?

How is the web interface tested?  Could we trust any infrastructure for testing the app?

Do we want to open source the app?
Might we ever want to charge for it (e.g. freemium)?  If so, need to ensure licences of any dependencies allow it.


# Misc

* To what extent has theFB branched Vanilla?
* Are we OK with extending the REST API?
* Is theFB wedded to Vanilla?
* If not, to what extent should we try to separate the front-end of the app from the Vanilla-facing backend?
